# Linear Algebra
This Program performs some basic Linear Algebra 1 functions.

# Example run:

$ java -jar LinearAlgebra.jar
Enter the point of vector one e.g 1,2,3
1,2,3
Enter the point of vector two e.g 4,5,6
4,5,6
Vector 1 entered is (1,2,3)
Vector 2 entered is (4,5,6)
Parametric Equations: x = 1 + 3t, y = 2 + 3t, z = 3 + 3t, 
Symmetric Equations: = ( x - 1 ) / 3  = ( y - 2 ) / 3  = ( z - 3 ) / 3  
Point [1, 2, 3] and Point [4, 5, 6] are on the line
